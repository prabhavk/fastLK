# About

Open-source software for computing the log-likelihood score of large phylogenies with short branches. This software has a special focus on covid-19. The C++ code that is made available here is a rewrite of the python code that can be found at https://github.com/NicolaDM/fastLK. 

# Instructions

Enter the directory where you have downloaded/extracted the files and run make. The exectuable is called fastLK.

The program optimizes non-stationary models and branch lengths for large phylogenies with short branches.
